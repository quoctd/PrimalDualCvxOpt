# PrimalDualCvxOpt
This is a Matlab code implementing new primal-dual methods for composite convex optimization
It implements the methods developed in the following papers:
 [1]. Q. Tran-Dinh and Y. Zhu: Non-Stationary First-Order Primal-Dual Algorithms with Fast NonErgodic Convergence Rates, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.05282.pdf.
